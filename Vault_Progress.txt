TODO:
	• game exe Icon
NEXT-GEN TODO:
	• make a mode where hacked cells are already there & enough to decypher the code
		need to investigate tech solutions to do this though
VARIANTS: ('ART' versions)
	• Pixel-art
	• Flat style with lighting effects (fake reflections like Steam library, reaction to mouse)
	• 3D? (would be nice to test/explore HD lighting effects)
	• Gears theme (what style would this fit?)

2024-08-07
	• 'complete/invalid' hacked cells feedbacks

	• create private repo on github & push
		had to rebase to update the email - default info in gitextensions was private email !!
			find noreply email provided by github on email prefs under the private email
			command to update email in git repo: git rebase -i --root -x "git commit --amend --author '...@users.noreply.github.com>' -CHEAD"
	• impossible cells with no possible flow are ok, and they propagate back to their origin to also filter origins when they are not possible
2024-08-04
	• Hint algo re-redone with flow info to be able to remove impossible cells in addition to filter guess cells
2024-08-03
	• Added custom mouse cursor
	• Hint algo finished & redone - was too complex to filter existing cells
2024-08-02
	• start on clicking a hacked cell & display hints for possible paths/values flooding the grid
	• Credits page, exclusive with Rules + menu close fix
	• more game sizes (3x3 > 8x8)
	• Unlock button / end game process
	• Add default Node script template with warning fixes
2024-08-01
	• Clean menu setup, add in-game memnu toggle, updated rules
	• Add code label for hacked cells on hover
	• Add target quadrant highlight for hacked cells hovering (clarify multiple quadrants target possibilities)
	• Setup quadrants (with even-sized boards complexity as a cell can be in multiple quadrants!)
	• Clean interactions
2024-07-31
	• Setup game board + spawn cells (parametric size)+ input interactions (guess & reset)
	• Setup splash + title + cell node + rules
	• Create project
